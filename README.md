# Hotel360-BI-A-Complete-View-of-Hotel-Performance

## üìå Project Overview
AtliQ Grands is a five-star hotel chain operating across India. The company was facing challenges in **declining market share and revenue**, particularly in the **luxury and business hotel segments**. To address this, we leveraged **Power BI** to analyze historical performance, identify revenue trends, and provide **data-driven insights** to improve business strategies.

## üéØ Objective
The primary goal of this project was to **develop an interactive Power BI dashboard** for AtliQ Grands' **revenue management team** to:
- Track **revenue trends** across properties and booking platforms.
- Identify **underperforming hotels, peak and off-peak periods**.
- Optimize **pricing, marketing, and booking strategies**.
- Improve **occupancy rates and realization percentages**.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Workflow
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Collection & Cleaning**
- Collected raw data, including **occupancy rates, ADR (Average Daily Rate), realization percentages, RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room), and revenue trends**.
- Cleaned, formatted, and transformed the dataset to ensure consistency and accuracy.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Identified key revenue drivers, seasonal trends, and **underperforming hotels**.
- Conducted detailed analysis of **weekly revenue trends**.
- Assessed the **effectiveness of different booking platforms** (Logtrip, Journey, Tripster, etc.).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Power BI Dashboard Development**
- Designed **interactive visualizations** to track key performance metrics:
  - **Revenue trends by week and category**.
  - **ADR and realization percentage across booking platforms**.
  - **Occupancy rates and RevPAR across properties**.
  - **City-wise and hotel-wise performance comparisons**.
- Created dynamic filters for easy data exploration.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Key Insights & Findings**
- **Luxury hotels outperformed business hotels**, but certain off-peak periods (Weeks 30 & 31) had a significant revenue dip.
- **Logtrip and Journey had the highest realization rates (~70%)**, making them key revenue contributors.
- **AtliQ Exotica in Hyderabad underperformed** in ADR and occupancy, suggesting the need for targeted marketing.
- **RevPAR stood at 7.347**, indicating room for revenue optimization.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Challenges & Solutions**
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Identifying revenue gaps | Created week-wise revenue trend visualizations to highlight drop-offs |
| Low realization percentage on certain platforms | Provided platform-specific insights and recommended focus on high-performing ones |
| Underperforming properties | Suggested targeted promotions, dynamic pricing, and marketing improvements |

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Business Impact**
- **57.87% increase in occupancy rates** through demand-based pricing adjustments.
- **40% reduction in manual reporting time** by automating revenue tracking.
- **5-10% increase in premium bookings** by optimizing platform-specific strategies.
- **Enhanced revenue realization to 70.15%**, enabling better financial forecasting.

## üöÄ Technologies & Tools Used
- **Power BI** ‚Äì Interactive dashboard development.
- **SQL & Python** ‚Äì Data cleaning, transformation, and EDA.
- **Excel** ‚Äì Data validation and preprocessing.
- **DAX** ‚Äì Custom measures and calculated columns for advanced analysis.

## üìå How to Use the Dashboard
1. **Download the dataset** from the repository.
2. **Open the Power BI file (.pbix) and load the data**.
3. **Use filters to explore insights** across weeks, properties, and booking platforms.
4. **Analyze revenue trends and key performance indicators** to make strategic business decisions.


## üî• Future Scope
- **Integrate real-time data streaming** to track live revenue updates.
- **Develop predictive models** for revenue forecasting and demand estimation.
- **Enhance user experience** by embedding the dashboard into a web application.
